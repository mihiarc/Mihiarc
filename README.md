# Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, an Environmental & Resource Economist with the U.S. Forest Service where I research the impact of climate change on natural resource management. My approch involves using big data to build econometric models that reveal the preferences of people and society, then use those models to evaluate how the landscape might be altered as humans adapt to a changing climate.

## Check out some of my research!

## My tools include:

### Data Wrangling and Econometric Modeling

Econometrics is all about estimating relationships, but before I can estimate a model the data's gotta be cleaned. R and RStudio are the tools I use for wrangling and model estimation.

### Cloud Computing and AI

I'm moving more and more of my work to the cloud for computing power using these tools:
