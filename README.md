# 🌍 **Hi, I’m Dr. Chris Mihiar** 👋  

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I am a **Research Economist** passionate about solving critical environmental and natural resource challenges through **data-driven insights** and **collaborative science**.

---

## 🚀 **About Me**  
I explore the dynamic interaction between **human decisions** and **natural systems** at the intersection of:

- 🌱 **Resource and Environmental Economics**  
- 🌳 **Land-Use Change**  
- 🔥 **Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation**  

With expertise in **econometric modeling** and **large-scale geospatial data**, my work aims to **inform actionable solutions** for sustainable land management under **climate change and climate-driven disturbances**.

📍 **Current Role**: Research Economist | USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station  
🎓 **Ph.D. Applied Economics** | Oregon State University

## 🧭 **What I Do**  

### 🌍 **Modeling Land-Use Change**  
Analyzing historical patterns and projecting **future land-use scenarios** under various climate and socioeconomic conditions.  
**Key Contribution**: [Resources Planning Act (RPA) Assessment](https://research.fs.usda.gov/inventory/rpaa/2020) - revealing trade-offs between economic and environmental goals.  

### 🌲 **Economics of Forest Management**  
Studying the impact of policies like **tax incentives** and **conservation programs** on wildfire risk, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem services.  

### 📊 **Natural Capital Accounting**  
Leading national initiatives to integrate **economic** and **ecological data** with **data science**, quantifying the value of forests' carbon storage and timber assets.

## 🎯 **Research Interests**  

- 🔎 **Climate Adaptation**: Strategies to address wildfires, water scarcity, and extreme weather events.  
- 🌿 **Sustainable Land Management**: Evaluating trade-offs among agriculture, forestry, and urban land development to improve resource sustainability.  
- 📈 **Market Innovations**: Exploring emerging markets for ecosystem services, such as **carbon** and **water markets**.  

**My Mission**: Deliver tools and insights that empower policymakers, landowners, and communities to navigate global environmental challenges.
